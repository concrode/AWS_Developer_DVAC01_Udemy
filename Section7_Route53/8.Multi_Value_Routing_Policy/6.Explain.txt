And so from the web browser perspective if I go to this URL

basically my web browser would have just picked

any of these three IPs at random and just used this one.

So if I just try it out and go here

as we can see my web browser is able to just choose an IP.

And if one of these was unhealthy for whatever reason

then because my web browser has other IPs

it will return as part of the answer

it can try the other ones and see which one would work.

Which is quite cool,

which gives us as well some kind of fault tolerance

but this time on the client side.
